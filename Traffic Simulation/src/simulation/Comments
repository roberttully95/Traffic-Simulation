Assumptions:
- Cars enter highway at an even time interval, lets say every 4 seconds to start.
- Cars enter highway travelling at the highway speed limit.

Vehicle Class:
	Constants:
	- length (4.5m)
	- acceleration (3.5 m/s^2)
	- deceleration (5.0 m/s^2)
	
	Variables:
	- Max Speed
	- Creation Time
	
	
Highway Class:
	Constants:
	- Speed Limit (75 mph, 33.528 m/s)
	
	Variables:
	- Length
	- Number of Lanes
	
	
Construction Zone Class:
	Variables:
	- Length
	- Number of Lanes
	- Speed Limit
	

Ideas:
	- Create a vehicle, wait the specified amount of time before the next vehicle enters.
		Each unit in the linked list will correspond to the length of one car.
		Each car will have a current distance travelled that will depend on the following:
		- Speed
		- Acceleration
		- Deceleration
		- If there is a car immediately in front of it.
